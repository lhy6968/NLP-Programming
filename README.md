Introduction

In today’s digital area, online shopping has be- come an indispensable part of most people’s life. As the popularity of e-commerce continues to grow, the need for effective recommender systems has become crucial. These systems aim to en- hance the quality of consumer goods while en- abling businesses to sell a greater quantity of prod- ucts. In this project, our team delves into recom- mender systems, specifically in the realm of cloth- ing products, applying multiple NLP models to ad- dress two key tasks.

Firstly, we tackle the challenge of Product Re- view Summarization. Given that most product re- views tend to be lengthy, consumers often tend to skip reading them. To solve this issue, we aim to train a model that can extract the core ideas from reviews and summarize them in a concise manner. By achieving this, we aim to facilitate better com- prehension and accessibility for users.

Secondly, we shift our focus on the review rat- ings of products, which is a trending research topic in recommender systems. Most researchers tend to analyze and predict ratings based on user infor- mation (such as using latent factor model) rather than utilizing contextual information. Therefore, we aim to bridge this gap by leveraging NLP mod- els to find out useful insights from textual content information.

Specifically, the inputs and outputs of our project are the following:

• Review Summarizer: Review texts → Re- view Summarization

• Review Rating Prediction: Review texts → Review Rating (an integer ranging from 1- 10)

For the tasks our team proposed, we accomplished all of them mentioned in the proposal, with only little modifications shown below.
